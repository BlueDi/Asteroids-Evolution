### Goal ###
The ships have to dodge asteroids while trying to catch food.

Every generation:
  * The best ones, the elite, will be replicated to the next generation;
  * All the other ships will be children of the previous generation, including the elite;
  * The ships of the new generation, except the elite, have a probability to mutate.

### Instructions ###
On click create an asteroid.

Press 'Space' to turn on/off Debug. With Debug activated you'll see output on the console about the generations of ships.
